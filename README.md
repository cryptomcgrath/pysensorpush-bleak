# pysensorpush

This is a work in progress to create some scripts which use gatttool to read data from a Sensorpush HT.w temperature sensor.  I am still in the process of reverse engineering things using Wireshark.  As I figure out more I'll update the scripts.  My goal is to be able to periodically read the temperature from a Raspberry PI Zero 2W and then use that temperature to turn on and off the furnace in my RV.  This way I can place the sensor next to the water tanks and the furnace can keep things from freezing while I am skiing.
